# Light Leapers Mod

## Description

A transportation mod, by RamGaming, that allows the player to harness the power of light to travel across the world. This mod is based off of the pathfinder concept from the book series "Keeper of the Lost Cities"

## Questions you may have

### Is this mod available for forge?

Not yet! I plan on creating a forge port once I finalize the first official release of the mod!

### Is this mod available for Minecraft <=1.18.x?

Most likely not. I may or may not create a FABRIC version for 1.18.x or 1.17 after the first official release.

### I found a bug! What do I do?

Head over to the issues tab and create an issue report. I will get on top of it as soon as I can!

### Could you add BLANK leaper to the mod?

Maybe, but you don't have to wait! The first official release will have data pack compatibility, allow players to add their own leapers via data packs.

### Could you add BLANK to the mod?

Maybe! Create a pull request or msg me on discord (Ramix#0467) with your idea!
